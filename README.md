# 📝  To-Do List

My third project on the road to becoming a Frontend Developer! After the currency converter, I took on a classic challenge: a To-Do List. This project was a major step up in terms of JavaScript architecture and professional CSS naming conventions.

The project utilizes modern JavaScript practices and advanced CSS techniques:
* **ES6+ Features**: Arrow functions, template literals, spread operators, and destructuring.
* **Advanced Array Methods**: Usage of `map`, `filter`, and `every` to ensure immutable state updates.
* **BEM Methodology**: Clean, modular, and maintainable CSS class naming.
* **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Modern layouts for a seamless and responsive user experience.


## Features 📈 

This application provides comprehensive task management:
* **Adding new tasks** – dynamically expanding the list.
* **Deleting tasks** – removing individual items from the list.
* **Toggling completion** – visual strike-through for finished tasks.
