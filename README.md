# 📝  To-Do List

My third project on the road to becoming a Frontend Developer! After the currency converter, I took on a classic challenge: a To-Do List. This project was a major step up in terms of JavaScript architecture and professional CSS naming conventions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. It features a clean, distraction-free interface where you can add, complete, and delete tasks in real-time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Concepts
* **HTML** 
* **CSS (BEM Methodology)** 
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Implemented dynamic rendering, array methods

## 🧠 What I Learned in this Project
* **Dynamic Rendering:** Instead of hardcoding HTML, I'm now generating it dynamically based on a data array (`tasks`)


## 📈 Key Features
* **Add Tasks:** Quick entry via button
* **Toggle Status:** Mark tasks as done with a single click (includes visual strike-through).
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove unwanted items from your list instantly.
* **Auto-focus:** The input field automatically regains focus for a faster workflow.
